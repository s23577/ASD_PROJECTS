This textbook draws heavily on the contributions of countless algorithms students, teachers, and researchers. In particular, I am immensely grateful to more than three thousand Illinois students who have used my lecture notes as a primary reference, offered useful (if sometimes painful) criticism, and suffered through some truly awful early drafts. Thanks also to many colleagues and students around the world who have used these notes in their own classes and have sent helpful feedback and bug reports. The more we reduce ourselves to machines in the lower things, the more force we shall set free to use in the higher. An algorithm is an explicit, precise, unambiguous, mechanically executable sequence of elementary instructions, usually intended to accomplish a specific purpose. Although they have been a topic of formal academic study for only a few decades, algorithms have been with us since the dawn of civilization. The most familiar method for multiplying large numbers, at least for American students, is the lattice algorithm. The lattice algorithm is not the oldest multiplication algorithm for which we have direct recorded evidence.
